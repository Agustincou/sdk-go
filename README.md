A comprehensive Go client library for integrating with the Mercado Pago API.

## üí° Requirements

The SDK requires Go 1.21 or higher.

## üì≤ Installation

First time using Mercado Pago? Create your [Mercado Pago account](https://www.mercadopago.com), if you don't have one already.

1. Install the Mercado Pago SDK for Go:
```sh
$ go install github.com/mercadopago/sdk-go
```

2. Import the SDK into your Go code:

```go
import "github.com/mercadopago/sdk-go"
```

That's it! The Mercado Pago SDK for Go has been successfully installed.

## üåü Getting Started

Simple usage looks like:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/mercadopago/sdk-go/pkg/config"
	"github.com/mercadopago/sdk-go/pkg/payment"
)

func main() {
	accessToken := "{{ACCESS_TOKEN}}"

	cfg, err := config.New(accessToken)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	req := payment.Request{
		TransactionAmount: 105.1,
		PaymentMethodID:   "visa",
		Payer: &payment.PayerRequest{
			Email: "{{EMAIL}}",
		},
		Token:        "{{CARD_TOKEN}}",
		Installments: 1,
	}

	client := payment.NewClient(cfg)
	pay, err := client.Create(context.Background(), req)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println(pay)
}
```

### SDK Configuration

Before making API requests, you need to initialize the SDK with your access token:

```go
	accessToken := "{{ACCESS_TOKEN}}"

	cfg, err := config.New(accessToken)
```

### Making API Requests

To make requests to the Mercado Pago API, you can use the methods provided by the SDK. For example, to create a payment, you can use the `Payment.Create` method:

```go
	req := payment.Request{
		TransactionAmount: 105.1,
		PaymentMethodID:   "visa",
		Payer: &payment.PayerRequest{
			Email: "{{EMAIL}}",
		},
		Token:        "{{CARD_TOKEN}}",
		Installments: 1,
	}

	client := payment.NewClient(cfg)
```

### Exception throwing handling

In both cases, client configuration and payment creation, the variable `err` is available, which will contain any error thrown, it is important to handle these errors in the best possible way
```go
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
```

For more details on the available methods and request parameters, please refer to the [Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mercadopago/sdk-go) documentation.
