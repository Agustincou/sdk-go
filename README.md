A comprehensive Go client library for integrating with the Mercado Pago API.

## üí° Requirements

The SDK requires Go 1.15 or higher.

## üì≤ Installation

First time using Mercado Pago? Create your [Mercado Pago account](https://www.mercadopago.com), if you don't have one already.

1. Install the Mercado Pago SDK for Go:
```sh
$ go get github.com/mercadopago/dx-go
```

2. Import the SDK into your Go code:

```go
import "github.com/mercadopago/dx-go"
```

That's it! The Mercado Pago SDK for Go has been successfully installed.

## üåü Getting Started

Simple usage looks like:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	mp "github.com/mercadopago/dx-go"
)

func main() {
	mp.SDK.Init("YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN")

	payment, err := mp.SDK.Payment.Create(&mp.PaymentCreateRequest{
		TransactionAmount: 1000.0,
		Token:             "your_cardtoken",
		Description:       "description",
		Installments:      1,
		PaymentMethodID:   "visa",
		Payer: &mp.PaymentPayerRequest{
			Email: "dummy_email",
		},
	})

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Mercado Pago Error. Status: %d, Content: %s\n", err.Status, err.Content)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println(payment)
}
```

### SDK Configuration

Before making API requests, you need to initialize the SDK with your access token. You can do this by calling the `Init` function:

```go
mp.SDK.Init("YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN")
```

### Making API Requests

To make requests to the Mercado Pago API, you can use the methods provided by the SDK. For example, to create a payment, you can use the `Payment.Create` method:

```go
payment, err := mp.SDK.Payment.Create(&mp.PaymentCreateRequest{
	TransactionAmount: 1000.0,
	Token:             "your_cardtoken",
	Description:       "description",
	Installments:      1,
	PaymentMethodID:   "visa",
	Payer: &mp.PaymentPayerRequest{
		Email: "dummy_email",
	},
})

if err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("Mercado Pago Error. Status: %d, Content: %s\n", err.Status, err.Content)
	return
}

fmt.Println(payment)
```

For more details on the available methods and request parameters, please refer to the [Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mercadopago/dx-go) documentation.
